# THE OBLIGATORY README

Hello!

This is a readme file that I haven't put anything of importance in yet.

This is the lab 1 branch of the repository.

I'm planning on putting every lab (and the assignment) into their own branches in the
repository, so, if you want to find each lab's stuff, please go to the branch for that
lab/the assignment

Also to see the exact range and distance stuff,
please launch 'ExactRangeInfoGuiForPhysicsEngine.java'

Thank you for your understanding.
