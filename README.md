# THE OBLIGATORY README

Hello!

This is a readme file that I haven't put anything of importance in yet.

This is the assignment branch of the repository.

I'm planning on putting every lab (and the assignment) into their own branches in the
repository, so, if you want to find each lab's stuff, please go to the branch for that
lab/the assignment

I intend to further enhance the enhanced version of the provided physics engine 
which I worked on during the labs in order to do the assignment, hence this
branch was made before the lab 5 branch (where JBox2D was first used), so (in theory)
I won't need to faff around with JBox2D jars where they aren't needed.

inb4 this decision bites me in the arse in a few weeks :^)

Thank you for your understanding.
