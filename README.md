# THE OBLIGATORY README

Hello!

This is a readme file that I haven't put anything of importance in yet.
Chances are you're looking at the 'template' branch right now (which is
just a template that I can then branch again to put stuff in for each
lab or for the assignment).

I'm planning on putting every lab (and the assignment) into their own branches in the
repository, so, if you want to find each lab's stuff, please go to the branch for that
lab/the assignment

Thank you for your understanding.
