# A Scientific Interpretation of Daily Life in the Space Towing Industry, Circa 3052 CE

A game I made for CE812 Physics-Based Games, using **CRAPPY**
(the ***C**ool **R**ealism-**A**djacent **P**hysics **P**ackage, **Y**'know?*)

**CRAPPY** was *also* made, by me, for the CE812 Physics-Based Games module.

In this game, you join the ranks of the noble members of the Space Towing Industry,
and your job is to fly into these caves,
pick up the mythical **Ball Of Being Towed In Space**,
and tow it back to where you came from!

And uhh try not to crash into anything!
