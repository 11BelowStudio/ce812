/**
 * CRAPPY:
 * Cool Realism-Adjacent Physics Package, Y'know?
 *
 * A physics engine created by Rachel Lowe for the CE812 Physics-Based Games module.
 *
 *
 * PLEASE NOTE: this uses constant gravity (not distance-dependent), but it does use distant-dependent connectors,
 * a customizable euler integrator (free to choose how many substeps you want it to take), tweakable gravity,
 * a really bad but functional interface which you can use for low-effort rendering, and a bunch of other
 * cool documented (and undocumented) features!
